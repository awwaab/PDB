9/26/16#8#Clinton#I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future#1.0
9/26/16#8#Clinton#That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business#1.0

9/26/16#8#Clinton#We also have to make the economy fairer#1.0
9/26/16#8#Clinton#That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work#1.0
9/26/16#9#Clinton#I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing#1.0
9/26/16#9#Clinton#If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top#1.0

9/26/16#11#Trump#You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product#1.0
9/26/16#11#Trump#They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight#1.0
9/26/16#11#Trump#Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them#1.0

9/26/16#11#Trump#Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving#1.0
9/26/16#11#Trump#But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us#1.0
9/26/16#11#Trump#We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people#1.0

9/26/16#14#Clinton#Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent#1.0
9/26/16#14#Clinton#And we need to have smart, fair trade deals#1.0
9/26/16#14#Clinton#We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions#1.0
9/26/16#14#Clinton#And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again#1.0
9/26/16#14#Clinton#In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had#1.0
9/26/16#14#Clinton#That is not how we grow the economy#1.0
9/26/16#14#Clinton#We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes#1.0
9/26/16#14#Clinton#And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.That's the kind of economy I want us to see again#1.0
9/26/16#15#Holt#Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans#1.0
9/26/16#15#Holt#How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?#1.0
9/26/16#16#Trump#Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs#0.0
9/26/16#16#Trump#Our country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals#1.0
9/26/16#16#Trump#And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no taxIt's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it#1.0
9/26/16#16#Trump#Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact. Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years#1.0
9/26/16#18#Trump#What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer#1.0
9/26/16#19#Holt#Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?#1.0
9/26/16#20#Trump#Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave#1.0
9/26/16#20#Trump#The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. The Companies are leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever#1.0
9/26/16#20#Trump#And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong#1.0
9/26/16#22#Clinton#Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm#1.0
9/26/16#22#Clinton#In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money". Well, it did collapse.#0.0
9/26/16#24#Clinton#Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place#1.0
9/26/16#24#Clinton#Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession#1.0
9/26/16#24#Clinton#They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy#1.0
9/26/16#24#Clinton#Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century#0.0
9/26/16#24#Clinton#Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real#0.0
9/26/16#28#Clinton#And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity#1.0
9/26/16#28#Clinton#So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place#1.0
9/26/16#30#Trump#She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt#1.0
9/26/16#30#Trump#The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact#1.0
9/26/16#30#Trump#So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone#1.0
9/26/16#30#Trump#And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions#7.0
9/26/16#35#Clinton#I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again. million new jobs, a balanced budget. Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts#1.0
9/26/16#39#Trump#He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country#1.0
9/26/16#40#Clinton#When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for.The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against#1.0
9/26/16#40#Clinton#I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals#7.0
9/26/16#40#Clinton#But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy#1.0
9/26/16#40#Clinton#I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable#1.0
9/26/16#40#Clinton#When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs#1.0
9/26/16#42#Trump#But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to#0.0
9/26/16#48#Trump#Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry#1.0
9/26/16#49#Clinton#Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion#0.0
9/26/16#50#Trump#You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA#1.0
9/26/16#51#Clinton#I was against Trans-Pacific Partnership once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out#1.0
9/26/16#54#Trump#You called Trans-Pacific Partnership the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen#1.0
9/26/16#56#Trump#And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against Trans-Pacific Partnership the gold standard#1.0
9/26/16#57#Clinton#Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts#0.0
9/26/16#57#Clinton#The facts are -- I did say I hoped Trans-Pacific Partnership would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated#1.0
9/26/16#59#Clinton#which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't#0.0
9/26/16#67#Clinton#There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt#1.0
9/26/16#77#Clinton#But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth#1.0
9/26/16#77#Clinton#We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business. So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession#1.0
9/26/16#78#Trump#You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it#1.0
9/26/16#78#Trump#And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs#1.0
9/26/16#78#Trump#But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence#1.0
9/26/16#78#Trump#When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation#1.0
9/26/16#78#Trump#You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse#1.0

9/26/16#139#Clinton#We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit#0.0
9/26/16#139#Clinton#So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons#0.0
9/26/16#139#Clinton#First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is#0.0
9/26/16#139#Clinton#Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be#0.0
9/26/16#140#Clinton#Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks#0.0
9/26/16#140#Clinton#Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax#0.0
9/26/16#141#Trump#That makes me smart#0.0
9/26/16#142#Clinton#So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health#0.0
9/26/16#142#Clinton#And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide#0.0

9/26/16#142#Clinton#We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding#0.0

9/26/16#162#Holt#And let's start by talking about race#3.0
9/26/16#162#Holt#The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa#3.0
9/26/16#162#Holt#Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap#3.0
9/26/16#162#Holt#So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this#0.0
9/26/16#163#Clinton#Well, you're right#0.0
9/26/16#163#Clinton#Race remains a significant challenge in our country#3.0
9/26/16#163#Clinton#Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system#3.0
9/26/16#161#Trump#I'm a year ahead of schedule,And that's what this country should be doing, We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost, We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule,And we should be able to do that for our country#1.0
9/26/16#163#Clinton#Well. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately,  race still determines too much often determines where people live.  determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get. it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system#3.0
9/26/16#163#Clinton#We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training#2.0
9/26/16#163#Clinton#Everyone should be respected by the law.  and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform#7.0
9/26/16#164#Clinton#I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize  in addition to the challenges that we face with policing. There are so many good  brave police officers who equally want reform#7.0
9/26/16#164#Clinton#And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men more than the next nine causes put together#7.0
9/26/16#164#Clinton#So we have to do two things as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today#2.0
9/26/16#166#Trump#Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order, If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long we need law and order in our country#7.0
9/26/16#166#Trump#I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot#2.0
9/26/16#166#Trump#In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st,Thousands of shootings, And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order.In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down.But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it#2.0
9/26/16#166#Trump#We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants,And they have guns, And they shoot people, And we have to be very strong, And we have to be very vigilant,We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated#2.0
9/26/16#168#Trump#No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed. The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling. No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them#2.0
9/26/16#170#Trump#These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago,#2.0
9/26/16#170#Trump#It's terrible what's going on in Chicago. But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good. But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things#2.0
9/26/16#173#Trump#But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen#7.0
9/26/16#175#Clinton#Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country#0.0
9/26/16#177#Clinton#You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.vIt did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences#2.0
9/26/16#177#Clinton#Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little#7.0
9/26/16#177#Clinton#We need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system. I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us#2.0
9/26/16#177#Clinton#Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.f you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way#2.0
9/26/16#179#Clinton#Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers#2.0
9/26/16#179#Clinton#I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that#2.0
9/26/16#184#Trump#First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists, When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.But I tend to agree with that quite strongly#2.0
9/26/16#184#Trump#I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth#2.0
9/26/16#184#Trump#I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg And it was terminated by current mayor.But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did It had a very, very big impact#2.0
9/26/16#189#Clinton#New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem#2.0
9/26/16#195#Trump#Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years. The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years#3.0
9/26/16#199#Trump#And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done#0.0
9/26/16#201#Clinton#I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing#0.0
9/26/16#204#Trump#I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard And you can go look it up, and you can check it out. And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it#0.0
9/26/16#208#Trump#Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true.Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved.But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce#0.0
9/26/16#215#Trump#Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing, But let me just tell you,When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community,I think you can see that, And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion, And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate#0.0
9/26/16#219#Clinton#And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down#0.0
9/26/16#221#Trump#I would love to respond, First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are, It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures, I don't think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt, It was very easy to do,I notice you bring that up a lot,And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things. I'll go one step further#0.0
9/26/16#222#Trump#In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club And I'm so glad I did it,And I have been given great credit for what I did,And I'm very, very proud of it, And that's the way I feel, That is the true way I feel#0.0
9/26/16#224#Clinton#Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries#2.0

9/26/16#226#Clinton#tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity,And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have#2.0
9/26/16#226#Clinton#We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare, But we will defend the citizens of this country, And the Russians need to understand that,I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do, And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans,That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations#2.0

So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.

9/26/16#233#Clinton#Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate#2.0
9/26/16#233#Clinton#And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles#2.0

9/26/16#235#Trump#We will take out ISIS, Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in," the way they got out was a disaster And ISIS was formed#2.0
9/26/16#235#Trump#So she talks about taking them out, She's been doing it a long time, She's been trying to take them out for a long time,But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that, And then you wouldn't have had them. Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income#2.0

9/26/16#241#Clinton#He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W, Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that#0.0

They were choking on the sanctions, And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going,But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?

9/26/16#246#Trump#I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton#2.0

But nobody called Sean Hannity And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04.

I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table.

Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong, It was actually $1, 7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages,It certainly looks that way, So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history#2.0
9/26/16#294#Trump#The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much, And they're going to end up getting nuclear,I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day,Believe me, he's not a happy camper#2.0
9/26/16#298#Clinton#It's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that#2.0
9/26/16#298#Clinton#And Donald never tells you what he would do, Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues,People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do,I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security#2.0

I was going to say something,extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself,I can't do it.I just can't do it. It's inappropriate, It's not nice, But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me,many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue, And they're misrepresentations,And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that,But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done,It's hundreds of millions of ads,And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money,$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing#0.0
